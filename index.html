                I was born in Bedford, Texas and have lived here in the North Dallas area most of my life. I love Texas, but there are many places to explore and I've only seen a few of them. So far Maui, Hawaii has been one of my favorite places I've been to.

                A fun fact: I am a United States Marine Veteran who worked as a flight equipment technician for all aircraft. I mainly worked on the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft. I was stationed at MCAS New River in Jacksonville, NC. I deployed overseas and got to see many different countries such as: Italy, Greece, Kuwait, etc.
